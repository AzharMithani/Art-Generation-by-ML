# Art-Generation-using-Neural-Style-Transfer

Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. It merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S. Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.
